  As part of the <strong>Database course project</strong>, we worked in a <strong>group of four</strong> to create 
  <em>EER diagrams</em> for e-commerce platforms such as <strong>Hepsiburada</strong>, <strong>Trendyol</strong>, and <strong>Amazon</strong>. 
  My responsibility was to <strong>design the EER diagram for Amazon</strong> and <strong>write its data requirements</strong>.
